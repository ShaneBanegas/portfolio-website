  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>Having a graphic design background has prepared me to solve problems visually, but now I want to solve problems for real people. My name is Shane Banegas and I am an upcoming UI/UX Designer. I discovered UX when I stumbled upon a video on YouTube video by UX Mastery's own Matthew Magain that simply explained... "What the #$%@ is UX Design?". Needless to say I was instantly hooked. Eventually I enrolled in a online UX Immersion course at CareerFoundry and finished in early May. I am so fascinated by everything that involves design, whether it be the visual part or the psychological part. I want to design products that are actually designed with the user in mind and I am looking forward to this new chapter in my life.</p>
